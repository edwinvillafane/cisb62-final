##### In this project I will try to forecast the last 200 days worth of Page Loads using historical data. The data used contains 5 years of daily time series data for several measures of traffic on a statistical forecasting teaching notes website whose alias is statforecasting.com. In this notebook, I go through EDA, data preprocessing and build two deep learning models, LSTM and ANN, optimize the models and make a final forecast.
